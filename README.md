# UGV-Pedestrian-Traffic-Sign-Detection
Deep Learning model for real-time American Pedestiran traffic light detection for Unmanned Ground Vehicles

Goal: To develop a robust Computer Vision system for UGV autonomous navigation with a specific focus on Pedestrian Safety Compliance.

System Function: Real-time detection and classification of all critical road signals, including the unique challenge of differentiating and interpreting Pedestrian Walk/Don't Walk (Go/Stop) signals, following American traffic standards.

Dataset Note: The model was trained using two merged datasets to ensure robust specific pedestrian signal styles (hand, walking figure).
